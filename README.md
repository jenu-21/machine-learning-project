# Machine Learning Projects

 A combination of 2 projects that test for classification and regression respectively. 
 Worked on data involving â€˜brain strokes' and 'airplane crashes'. 

## Brain Stroke Classification

Developed various models, such as KNN and SVM to predict the number of occurrences of brain strokes. 

#### Basic EDA

#### Process of machine learning classification

##### Normalise the data
- To ensure the categorical variables are encoded for the tests

##### Train-Test Split 
- The train-test split is a crucial step in machine learning model development, primarily for evaluating the model's performance and generalisation ability

- Scaling the data ensures that the machine learning algorithm can effectively learn from the data and produce better results, especially for algorithms sensitive to feature scales.

##### Using Predictions

##### Classification Report with confusion matrix

All these processes have been applied to various classification methods such as KNN, Dtree, SVM AND Gradient boosting machine

##### Issue of imbalanced dataset

This was sorted by utilising techniques such as random oversampling, SMOTE and other sampling techniques to get results like this

## Airplane Crash Regression Analysis

Performed various regression analysis such as multiple linear and polynomial regressions to predict the number of occurrences of crashes.

#### Data Cleaning

- Removed null values, particularly in key columns of consideration

#### EDA

#### Regression Analysis 

- Similar methods of the prior project above with train-testing split, encoding categorical variables, predictions

##### Methods incorporated
The regression analysis was done on 3 models:
- Multiple Linear
- Polynomial
- Ridge Regression

Utilising MSE, RMSE and R-Squared test to evaluate the best model
